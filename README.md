datalib is an API that makes data interaction simple. Functions include writing and appending to files, writing and reading tables, and more. This mod is still work in progress, and new functionality will be added from time to time, so read the updating instructions below to make sure you always have the latest version.

## API
See API.md, also available at the official [datalib wiki](http://208.69.243.45:3000/octacian/datalib/wiki) through Gogs ([http://208.69.243.45:3000/octacian/datalib/wiki](http://208.69.243.45:3000/octacian/datalib/wiki)).

### Installation and Updates
Unzip the archive, rename the folder to servertools and place it in `minetest/mods` or in the mods folder of the subgame in which you wish to use ServerTools.

You can also install this mod in the `worldmods` folder inside any world directory to use it only within one world.

To update, periodically check the [Gogs repository](http://208.69.243.45:3000/octacian/datalib) and download either the latest release or the master branch (most up to date, but often unstable).

The mod will soon include an auto update function, which will work on its own so long as you have internet.
